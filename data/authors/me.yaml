bio: "Yixuan Wang is a highly accomplished Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Arizona State University, specializing in the interdisciplinary fields of Human-AI Interaction, Large Language Model (LLM) research, and Explainable AI (XAI). With over four years of experience, his research focuses on advancing machine learning system development and evaluation, particularly in the areas of AI trust calibration and uncertainty quantification. Yixuan has published first-author work in leading venues like IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and the International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction , where he developed simulation-based frameworks using Python and PyTorch to quantify cost-benefit tradeoffs in interactive ML systems and rigorously evaluated XAI techniques and their impact on human trust. Demonstrating strong engineering proficiency alongside his research expertise, he has built scalable experimental infrastructures, developed visual analytics systems for federated learning at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) , and engineered robust data pipelines and a full-stack monitoring system using Flask, React, and SQL during his industry experience as a Data Engineer Intern at Wayfair."
